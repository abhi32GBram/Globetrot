Added Local Tunneling using Ngrok : 
 * ngrok allows you to expose your local development environment to the public internet securely. 
 * This means you can access your application or website running on your machine (localhost) from anywhere in the world through an ngrok-generated URL. 
 * This is particularly useful for:
-- collaborating with others
-- Testing APIs
-- Public demos

Installing Ngrok by : 
-- Downloading the zip file
-- Setting the system env variable path of the folder address where the ngrok.exe is present
-- Make an account on Ngrok for getting your own Authtoken 
   --- Put it in the terminal and specify the port number (same as your application )
   ## Make sure to keep the app running in localhost 
   --- A Forwading link will be generated everytime we launch ngrok 
-- Go to the Domains section in Cloud Edge of Ngrok dashboard and get a new domain which is free but and only 1 per account
   --- Use that URL and specify the port number in the end
   ## This is just so that we dont always generate new Forwading links when accessing through Ngrok
