Added Local Tunneling using Ngrok : 
 * ngrok allows you to expose your local development environment to the public internet securely. 
 * This means you can access your application or website running on your machine (localhost) from anywhere in the world through an ngrok-generated URL. 
 * This is particularly useful for:
-- collaborating with others
-- Testing APIs
-- Public demos

Installing Ngrok by : 
-- Downloading the zip file
-- Setting the system env variable path of the folder address where the ngrok.exe is present
-- Make an account on Ngrok for getting your own Authtoken 
   --- Put it in the terminal and specify the port number (same as your application )
   ## Make sure to keep the app running in localhost 
   --- A Forwading link will be generated everytime we launch ngrok 
-- Go to the Domains section in Cloud Edge of Ngrok dashboard and get a new domain which is free but and only 1 per account
   --- Use that URL and specify the port number in the end
   ## This is just so that we dont always generate new Forwading links when accessing through Ngrok

Configuring Webhooks : 

* Webhooks are like automated messengers for websites and applications. 
* They allow them to communicate with each other instantly whenever something specific happens.
* Think of them as little robots that are constantly listening for events and then sending out notifications when those events occur.

Clerk Webhooks : 

## Everyday stuff 
-- Run = npm run dev
-- Run = Domain link from Ngrok

--- In the Clerk Dashboard go to the Webhooks section and hit - create new 
--- Get the perma domain from the running ngrok terminal and put in the Endpoints field of Clerk followed by - /api/webhooks/clerk
--- Enable all the User event in the Messge Filtering section below; Click Create
--- Copy the Sign-In Secret and rename it to CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET in the env file 
--- Install the svix library using - npm install svix
--- Make a folder structure in the App directort - app\api\webhooks\clerk\route.ts 
--- To enable Nextjs to be able to send Messages in the middleware file add this in the authMiddleware object :
   == publicRoutes: ["/api/webhooks(.*)"]
--- Write the necessary conditionals in the route.ts file to manage the CRUD ops of the user for the main app & reflect changes in the DB
